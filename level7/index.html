"He picked the books up and was surprised when he saw some writing in the book. The professor decides to take the books home to investigate. However while walking to his car he finds a dead student.",
"The student was stabbed multiple times but there was no sign of anyone in sight. While hurrying to his car he found out that it was flooded and it no longer worked so he ran to the train station.",
"Of course the one day heâ€™s in a hurry they are short staffed and the usual guy who checks him in isn't there. Who could have killed this innocent student? Why were there books left in the parking lot with a message on it? Were there multiple criminals involved?"],
